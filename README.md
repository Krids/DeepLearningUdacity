# Getting Started With NLP

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.X** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [keras](https://keras.io/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer and not the Python 2.7 installer. 

### Notebooks:

- Word2Vec
- NotMnist

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `GettingStartedWithNLP/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook 1_notmnist.ipynb
ipython notebook 5_word2vec.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook 1_notmnist.ipynb
jupyter notebook 5_word2vec.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
